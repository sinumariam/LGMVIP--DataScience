# LGMVIP--DataScience
This Repository contains my projects I completed during my Data Science Internship with LetsGrowMore

### Tasks
1. Develop a Deep Neuaral Network that can read Handwriting

  Problem Statement:
* Create a Neural Network Machine Learning Model that can identify Handwritten digits using Tensorflow and CNN on MNIST Dataset
* Dataset : MNIST DATASET


2. Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm 

  Problem Statement:
* Create Decision Tree Classifier and Visualise it Graphically
* If we feed any data into Classifier, it should be able to predict the right class accordingly

3. Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

  Problem Statement:
* Develop a Python Programme to get the Pencil Sketch of a RGB Image

4. Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM
 
 Problem Statement:
* Use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) approach to predict stock market indices on the given dataset.
